# IT/Software Project Estimator - PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build an IT/Software Project estimator tool named "YASH EstPro" with comprehensive project estimation, cost calculation, workflow approval, and dashboard analytics.

## What's Been Implemented

### Core Features (Complete)
- JWT authentication + RBAC (Admin/Approver/User)
- Master data CRUD: Customers, Technologies, Project Types, Base Locations, Skills, Proficiency Rates, Sales Managers

- Review workflow: Draft -> In Review -> Approved/Rejected
- Audit log system
- Excel import/export with Sales Manager field
- Dockerization for on-premise deployment

### Dashboard (Feb 26, 2026 - Complete)

- **Value by Status breakdown** (Draft/In Review/Approved/Rejected values)
- **Multi-select filters**: Date, Customer, Project Type, Location, Sales Manager
- **Combination-grouped KPI charts**: Technology, Project Type, Location, Sales Manager — grouped by exact multi-select combinations (e.g., "UAE, KSA" as one bar)
- **Project numbers on hover tooltip** for all KPI bars
- **Clickable KPI bars** — navigate to Projects list with filter pre-applied
- **Sales Manager Leaderboard** with approval rates
- **Period Comparison Mode** — compare two date ranges side-by-side with delta indicators
- Projects by Status pie chart, Estimation Value Trend, Top Customers

### Notifications (Complete)

## Prioritized Backlog

### P2 - Low Priority
- [ ] User Profile - Custom Theme (upload background image)
- [ ] Export to PDF
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] SMTP configuration for email notifications
- [ ] Refactor ProjectEstimator.js local calc functions to use shared utility
